![Energy Sharing](documentation/assets/images/Pwr.png)

Our first project is to provide a decentralised platform that allow anyone to use, store, share & sell energy they have harvested locally without the need for expensive electricity grids transmitting energy over hundreds of kilometres.

With electric cars now a reality, charging the devices the empower us will be one of the main growth areas in the next few years especially in parts of the world with severe energy poverty.

### Project File Structure
The BuidlBox is a production ready boilerplate. During Beta the file structure is liable to change/simplify. However, you can always expect to be able to spin-up the BuidlBox and have a complete Site/Dashboard application ready-to-go.
